 EEG Signal Processing and Sleep Stage Detection

This project analyzes EEG data using MATLAB. It covers preprocessing, brainwave band extraction, and identifying sleep stages through time-frequency analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- EEG time and frequency domain analysis
- Brainwave band isolation (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
- Sleep stages and corresponding EEG characteristics
- Spectral power visualization and interpretation
